# What is a news update?

News updates are a great way to garner your game some new or renewed publicity. They are the primary means of staying in contact with your game's followers. Post news updates whenever something interesting happens with your game. Followers will be sent notifications and the news will be archived on your game page.

If you upload a new version of your game, hit a major milestone in development, update a changelog, or release a trailer, you should take the time to make a news update.

## How do I post a news update?

The best news updates are occasional and contain interesting and important information. Embedded images go a long way in keeping readers interested.

We recommend using [Imgur](http://imgur.com/) to host the images. News updates are composed in [Markdown](https://help.gamejolt.com/markdown), which allows you to embed screenshots and other images. Although video is currently not supported, you can always add animated gifs!

Be sure to space out your news updates and limit yourself to about 1 update per week. If you post too often, your followers may ignore your updates and even unfollow your game. If your news is not big enough for a news update, consider using [Twitter](www.twitter.com)!

To create a news update for a particular game, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select the game from under "Your Games". On the game's overview page, visit the "News" tab and click "Add Game News".
