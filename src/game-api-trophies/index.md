# Trophies

Trophies are intended for games that utilize the [Game Jolt Game API](http://gamejolt.com/developers/achievements). Once your game is integrated with the Game API, you can add different types of trophies for players to achieve while playing your game! Assign your trophies wisely since they offer Game Jolt EXP points to the player once achieved.

## Types of Trophies

The material of the trophy corresponds to how easy or difficult they are to earn. Each type of trophy offers Game Jolt EXP points.

- **Bronze** – 5 Game Jolt EXP - Easy
- **Silver** – 10 Game Jolt EXP – Intermediate
- **Gold** - 15 Game Jolt EXP - Challenging
- **Platinum** – 20 Game Jolt EXP – Difficult (4x more challenging than Bronze)

**Secret** trophies are great as bonus challenges! Once a trophy is marked Secret, only the name and difficulty level will be shared with the users. All other details will stay a secret until it is achieved.

## How to customize a trophy

While adding the trophy of your choice, upload a square image to customize its look. You can even give your trophies clever titles and descriptions!

## Hide/Unhide a trophy

Test out your trophies while they are hidden, only you can see them! Select to hide or unhide an existing trophy by clicking on it from the Game API, Trophy tab. Or you can select to hide or unhide while adding the trophy for the first time.

## What are the requirements and guidelines for trophy images?

- Use a square image.
- The image format can be PNG, JPG, or GIF. PNGs will result in the highest quality.
- Your original image should be as large as possible.
- The maximum width and height dimensions are 2000x2000px.
- The maximum file size is 3MB. If your file is larger, try compressing and/or optimizing the image.
- Only use an original image created or captured by you or your team.
