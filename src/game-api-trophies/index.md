# Trophies

Trophies are intended for games that utilize the [Game Jolt Game API](http://gamejolt.com/developers/achievements). You can set up different types of trophies on Game Jolt before integrating them into your game. Assign your trophies wisely since they offer Game Jolt EXP points to the player once achieved.

## Difficulty Levels

The material of the trophy corresponds to how easy or difficult they are to achieve. Each type of trophy offers Game Jolt EXP points.

- **Bronze** – 5 Game Jolt EXP
- **Silver** – 10 Game Jolt EXP
- **Gold** - 15 Game Jolt EXP
- **Platinum** – 20 Game Jolt EXP (should be 4x more challenging than Bronze)

**Secret trophies** are great as bonus challenges! When a trophy is marked Secret, only the name and difficulty level will be shared with the users. All other details will stay hidden until it is achieved.

## What are the requirements and guidelines for trophy images?

Trophy images aren't required, but we highly recommend adding them.

- Use a square image.
- The image format can be PNG, JPG, or GIF. PNGs will result in the highest quality.
- Your original image should be as large as possible.
- The maximum width and height dimensions are 2000x2000px.
- The maximum file size is 3MB. If your file is larger, try compressing and/or optimizing the image.
- Only use an original image created or captured by you or your team.

## Testing Trophies

Keep trophies hidden while testing your game's integration, only you will be able to see them.
