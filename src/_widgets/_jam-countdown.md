## Countdown Timer

Shows a countdown timer indicating when the next period of your jam will hit. Timers help to dispel any confusion around timezones as they show the amount of time left.

- Before the jam has begun, the timer will count down to the start of the jam.
- While the jam is running, the timer will count down to the end of the jam.
- After the jam ends, if your jam has a voting period, the timer will count down to the end of the voting period.

_Note that after the jam is over, the timer will automatically disappear from where you've placed it, as there's nothing to count down to anymore._

#### Syntax

{% raw %}
```
{% countdown %}
```
{% endraw %}

#### Notes

You can change the theme from light to dark in the theme customizer to make sure it fits your site's styling.
