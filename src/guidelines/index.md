# Site Guidelines

**Welcome to Game Jolt!**

Game Jolt is freely open to people of all kinds and from all different places. Our aim is to have a welcoming, friendly and supportive community for everyone to enjoy!

Because Game Jolt is so diverse, having clearly defined guidelines will help all of us to remain open-minded and tolerant of one another. Failure to follow these guidelines can lead to content being removed, users getting blocked from certain Communities, or even being permanently banned or removed from Game Jolt. Though it is necessary, taking such action saddens us, so we ask that you please consider these guidelines carefully so that we can have as big and happy a community as possible!

Without further ado, we present to you the Game Jolt Site Guidelines! üéâüéâüéâ

## Ways to be a good Game Jolt Citizen

- **Remember you‚Äôre talking to real people!**

  When speaking to others on Game Jolt, always remember that they are real people with real feelings, just like you! Pretend you are speaking to other Game Jolt users in person. For example, ask yourself: ‚ÄúIs what I am about to say something I would say in real life?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWould I appreciate it if someone said this to me?‚Äù Being considerate of the feelings of others will help you to be among Game Jolt‚Äôs finest citizens!

- **Read Community descriptions and adhere to their rules.**

  Every Community on Game Jolt is different and may have its own set of rules. Always check a Community's description for specific guidelines on posting and expected behavior.

- **Keep posts on topic.**

  Thinking about publishing a post to a Community or two? Ensure your post is on topic with the Communities you have selected, and send it to the appropriate channel.

- **Always link the source.**

  Many of us love sharing our favorite art, videos and music. If the content was not created by you, it would only be right to credit and link to the content‚Äôs original creator. After all, if you like something enough to share it, why not direct some attention to the person who worked so hard on it? Please note that some Communities only allow original content, so again, check those Community guidelines before posting!

- **Be constructive in criticism.**

  Have you found user-created content that you think could be improved? That‚Äôs fine; we all have opinions! Speak up about your concerns and leave a comment, but be constructive and gracious in your criticism. Think about how you would solve the issue if it were your own content and then voice your ideas accordingly. People work hard on their various creations and will appreciate your feedback when delivered with care.

- **Accept the block.**

  Game Jolt has a blocking feature that allows everyone the option to choose not to see content or notifications from certain users. This feature is for the benefit of all. We know it can hurt to find you‚Äôve been blocked by someone or a Community, but after giving some consideration to whether there‚Äôs anything you can improve in yourself for future interactions, try to apply whatever you may have learned and move on, forgive and forget. Blocking should not be considered an insult, especially since we do not know the individual circumstances of each person.

  Harassing users or Communities for blocking you by making posts about said users/Communities, or directing attacks from your friends and followers, is not acceptable conduct.

- **Send a report.**

  If you see someone doing something wrong on Game Jolt, please do not direct everyone else‚Äôs attention to the matter. Rather, use the report button found on every user profile, game page, post and comment to report the issue for our moderators to review. Handling matters this way will ensure a more positive experience for other users.

  When reporting something, always provide as much information as possible so our moderators know what the issue is and can react quickly and efficiently.

  However, please do not abuse the report button. Reporting an individual or content multiple times in succession for the exact same offense, reporting for the same offense via the use of multiple accounts belonging to one user, and slander are not acceptable. One truthful report per offense from each affected user is all it takes to help our team get to the bottom of things.

## Bannable offenses on Game Jolt

The following items will help to define some of the bannable offenses on Game Jolt. These are things that, if done, may result in someone's account being banned or even completely removed from the site.

Note that our moderators research and react to everything on a case by case basis. This means the results of an offense will vary and some offenses that result in disciplinary action may not be included on this list at all. While the reporting feature helps us get a better understanding of a situation, we still carefully review the actions of each user before making any decisions.

The following offenses apply to all forms of content on Game Jolt including but not limited to games, Communities, posts, comments, shouts and personal messages.

- **Harassment and abuse**

  Harassment and abuse are vague terms and can come in many forms. Harassment and abuse on Game Jolt include but are not limited to:

  - Hate speech.
  - Racism.
  - Belittling someone for their actions, ideas or beliefs.
  - Calling someone out in a negative context in a public space.
  - Offensive images, videos and animations.
  - Posting screenshots or video of private conversations without permission of the involved parties.
  - Leaking/posting privately shared information or content (known as "doxxing").
  - Targeted spam.
  - Creating Communities aimed to defame or harass others.
  - Lashing out at a moderator for any action taken on the site. They are people too, and they‚Äôre doing their best to help make Game Jolt better for everyone. Please remember that moderators often have access to evidence that goes unseen by other users.
  - Submitting false reports in an attempt to get someone or something you don‚Äôt like banned or removed.

- **Spam, scams and malicious conduct**

  Spam and scams are unfortunately commonplace in the wild world of the internet, but we do not welcome such content here. On Game Jolt, spam, scams and malicious conduct include but are not limited to:

  - Off-topic posts in Communities that don't have a specified channel for such content.
  - Excessive and/or repeated tagging of users in posts, comments and other content.
  - Posting nonsensical text or images (i.e. content that is not intended to make sense in the first place).
  - Posts that include links to off-topic or monetized external websites.
  - Repeatedly posting in quick succession.
  - Duplicate posts.
  - Performing actions that result in notifications on a single user‚Äôs content in quick succession with negative intention. For example, following users and games.
  - Using bots or scripts to post, like, and follow content at inhumane rates.
  - Phishing.
  - Spreading malware or viruses.

- **Theft and plagiarism**

  Theft and plagiarism is a widespread issue. On Game Jolt, we do our best to ensure our users are not claiming the work of others to be their own. Theft and plagiarism include but are not limited to:

  - Uploading a game you did not create.
  - Falsely claiming to have created content you are posting. Please note that it‚Äôs okay to share the work of others, but you should always credit and link back to the original source/creator.
  - Modifying and posting the work of others without first gaining permission and/or following the terms of the content‚Äôs original owner.

- **Impersonation**

  Impersonation includes both the derogatory imitation of, and posing as, other people or organizations via usernames or display names, posted content, and behavior and mannerisms. In spite of the verification of some user and organization accounts helping to prove identity, the above still applies; do not impersonate verified accounts.

- **Unauthorized posting of private information**

  On Game Jolt, we value everyone‚Äôs privacy and do our absolute best to ensure that private information remains that way. As such, sharing personally identifiable information or content that may reveal private details about others is unacceptable.

- **Adult content**

  Illicit or realistic pornography and gore is not permitted on Game Jolt.

  Here‚Äôs a list of where adult content is allowed, along with rules that should be followed for each area:

  - Games

    - The thumbnail must not contain any explicit content.
    - The game must both be given the appropriate maturity rating and marked as Adult. To mark a game as Adult, add the hashtag `#adult` into the game‚Äôs description on its game page.

  - Posts

    - The post should be on topic for its location and not be found in any inappropriate places. For example, a Community that doesn‚Äôt allow or feature adult content.
    - No NSFW media (images, youtube videos, models) are allowed. You can include adult content in the article of a post, but only if the lead of the post gives proper warning of the content contained within.
    - No surprise adult content. Again, users should be provided with clear warnings so as not to accidentally encounter NSFW (not safe for work) content.
