## Lists

Make lines of text into a bulleted list by placing a dash `-` or an asterisk `*`, followed by a space, before each line.

```
- This is a list item.
- Another list item.
* Still part of the list.
```

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>

- This is a list item.
- Another list item.
* Still part of the list.

#### Numbered Lists

Make a numbered list by simply starting each line with a number followed by a period `.` and a space.

```
1. This is the first item.
1. This is the second item.
1. Notice that we can use any number...
4. and the list will automatically be renumbered correctly.
```

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>

1. This is the first item.
1. This is the second item.

4. and the list will automatically be renumbered correctly.
