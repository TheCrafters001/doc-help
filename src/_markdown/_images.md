## Images

You can add an image from the web to your comment using this format:

```
![alt text](http://oi55.tinypic.com/111o2di.jpg)
```

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>

![alt text](http://oi55.tinypic.com/111o2di.jpg)

Start the line with an exclamation point `!` followed by some alt text in brackets `[ ]`. Next comes the image's URL in parentheses `( )`.

The alt text should be a very brief description of the image. It's used by search engines and in some cases when images are not displayed, such as when a visually impaired person uses a screen reader.
