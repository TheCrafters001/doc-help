## Code

#### Inline Code

You can add inline code tags to any piece of text by putting a backtick <code>`</code> on each side. The designated text will be displayed using a special fixed-width font.

```
Tweet out jam activity with the hashtag `#blahjam` if you want to be nice.
```

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>

Tweet out jam activity with the hashtag `#blahjam` if you want to be nice.

#### Fenced Code

You can create a fenced block of code by preceding it and following it with a line of three apostrophes <code>```</code>.

<pre><code>And here's how you annoy someone with JavaScript...

```
while ( true ) {
confirm( 'Do you like turtles?' );
}
```</code></pre>

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>
