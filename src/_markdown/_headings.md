## Headings

Create headings by placing 1 to 6 hashes `#` in front of your header text. Use 1 `#` for an H1 (the biggest), use 2 `##` for an H2 (the next biggest), and so on.

```
# This is an H1
## This is an H2
###### This is an H6
```

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>

# This is an H1
## This is an H2
###### This is an H6
