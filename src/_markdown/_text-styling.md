## Text Styling

#### Emphasis

Wrap text in asterisks `*` to _italicize_ it. Put double asterisks `**` around text to make it **bold**.

```
Hey, here is something *italicized* and here is some other thing **bold**.
```

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>

Hey, here is something *italicized* and here is some other thing **bold**.

Alternatively, you can use underscores `_` instead of asterisks `*`. This can help with double-styling pieces of text.

```
__I want this whole sentence bold, but only *this part* to be italicized and bold.__ This part won't have any emphasis added.
```

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>

__I want this whole sentence bold, but only *this part* to be italicized and bold.__ This part won't have any emphasis added.

#### Deletion

Wrap your text in double tildes `~~` to add a strikethrough.

```
I would love to make ~~a game~~ money.
```

<h5 class="text-muted">RESULT</h5>

I would love to make ~~a game~~ money.
