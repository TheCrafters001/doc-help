# What is the Game API?

Our Game API (application control interface) lets your games exchange information with the Game Jolt servers. Implementing the Game API will allow you to add a number of features to your game, including:

- Online score tables 
- Trophies (achievements) 
- Cloud data storage 
- Game session logging 
- User verification and auto-login
