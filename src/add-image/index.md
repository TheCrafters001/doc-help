# Adding images to my game page

The images on your game page will be an influencing factor in terms of getting people to commit to play and/or download your game. Many people will simply skip over a game page with no screenshots so it is vital that you post images of your game that are relevant and flattering.

If your game is a work-in-progress, it's essential to post images in order to get--and keep--people interested in your game. Screenshots in particular are excellent proof of progress.

Say you built your game's graphics out of clay; a photo of the models might make a cool image. Or maybe you built a custom arcade cabinet for your game, or some mockup box art; an image of that would be great.

## What are the image requirements and guidelines?

 - The image format can be PNG, JPG, or GIF. PNGs will result in the highest quality.
 - Your original image should be as large as possible.
 - The maximum width and height dimensions are 5120x2880px.
 - The maximum file size is 3MB. If your file is larger, try compressing and/or optimizing the image.
 - Only use an original image created or captured by you or your team.

## How to add images
