# Adding images to my game page

Images may be the most vital element of your game page in terms of catching the attention of people who have already been enticed by your thumbnail, or who are visiting via a direct link to your page. Many people will simply skip over a game with no screenshots.

If your game is a work-in-progress, it's essential to post images in order to get--and keep--people interested in your game. Screenshots in particular are excellent proof of progress.

Images can keep players coming back for more, for instance if they've glimpsed things in the images that they haven't yet seen in the game.

Most images on game pages are screenshots of the game. You can upload images that aren't screenshots, but only post images that are relevant. Say you built your game's graphics out of clay; a photo of the models might make a cool image. Or maybe you built a custom arcade cabinet for your game, or some mockup box art; an image of that would be great.

## How to add images

To add images, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select a game from under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's overview page. Visit the "Media" tab and start adding images!

Images can be any size and a few different formats, but a here are a couple general rules of thumb:

1. The bigger the image, the better the quality. 
2. A PNG will almost always yield the best quality.
