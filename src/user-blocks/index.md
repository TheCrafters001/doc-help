# How does blocking a user work?

User blocking is a feature that allows you to control when a user can interact with your account. In particular, they will be unable to comment on your things, send you notifications or follow you.

### How to block a user?

There are two ways of blocking a user on Game Jolt:

 - Navigate to your Edit Account page, and select "Blocked Users". Click "Block User" and enter the username (without the `@`) into the form and press "Block".
 - Visit the user's profile and find the "Block User" option in the "..." menu.

### Here's a more detailed list of effects that occur when blocking a user:

 - Users you have blocked will be *unable to follow you*, and you cannot follow them.
 - Any existing *friendship* between you and the blocked user will be revoked.
   - This means they also won't be able to send you chat messsages.
 - The blocked user will not be notified of you blocking them. However the blocked user will see a notice when visiting your profile informing them about the block.
 - When you come across a comment or post made by the blocked user outside of their profile, it will be hidden. You can click a button that unhides the comment or post if you choose to do so.
 - You will not encounter the blocked user in user recommendations.

### Restrictions that apply to users you blocked:
 
 - They cannot follow you
 - They cannot send you friend requests
 - They cannot send you collaboration invites to their games or communities
 - They cannot send chat messages to you
