# Trophies

Trophies are intended for games that utilize the [Game Jolt Game API](https://gamejolt.com/developers/achievements). You can set up different trophies on Game Jolt before integrating them into your game. Assign materials to your trophies carefully because they award Game Jolt EXP points to the player when achieved.

## Trophy materials

Trophy materials correspond to how easy or difficult they are to achieve. Each material offers a set amount of Game Jolt EXP points:

- **Bronze** – 5 Game Jolt EXP
- **Silver** – 10 Game Jolt EXP
- **Gold** – 15 Game Jolt EXP
- **Platinum** – 20 Game Jolt EXP (Platinum should be 4x more challenging than Bronze!)

**Secret trophies** are great bonus challenges! When a trophy is marked Secret, only its name and difficulty level will be visible to players. Everything else will stay hidden until it is achieved.

## Trophy images

Trophy images aren't required, but we highly recommend adding them to make your trophies stand out.

Here are the guidelines for trophy images:

- Use a square image.
- The image format can be PNG or JPG. PNGs will result in the highest quality.
- Your original image should be as large as possible.
- The maximum dimensions are 2000x2000px.
- The maximum file size is 3MB. If your file is larger, try compressing and/or optimizing the image.
- Only use an original image created or captured by you or your team.

## Testing trophies

You can keep trophies hidden while testing your game's integration. Only you, the developer, will be able to see hidden trophies.
