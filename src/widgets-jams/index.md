Widgets are pieces of placeholder code that are replaced by dynamic content. They start with `{%` and end with `%}`. In between goes the widget's name and any necessary parameters.
{% endraw %}

You can use widgets to enhance your jam pages with features that wouldn't otherwise be possible in <a href="../markdown-jams">Markdown</a> or simple HTML, such as a countdown timer or an activity feed.

{% include "_widgets/_jam-countdown.md" %}
{% include "_widgets/_jam-activity-feed.md" %}
{% include "_widgets/_youtube.md" %}
{% include "_widgets/_vimeo.md" %}
{% include "_widgets/_soundcloud.md" %}
