# What is a page header?

Headers are the big, banner-like images that adorn the tops of game pages. They are optional but highly, highly recommended. Headers make for a splendid looking page.

You might want to experiment with different images to see what looks good as a header. Screenshots often turn out well, but some of the nicest looking headers are created for the purpose. 

## What are the header requirements and guidelines?

Here are the requirements and recommendations for header images:

- The image format can be PNG, JPG, or GIF. PNGs will result in the highest quality. 
- In general, your image should be as large as possible. 
- The minimum recommended width is 1920. Images less wide than this will be automatically enlarged. The maximum width is 5120.
- The minimum ratio (width/height) is 2.7 and the maximum ratio is 6.3. The recommended ratio is 4. 
	- We recommend making the width 400% of the height (it has to be between 271.5% and 630%). 
    - To find a good height, divide the width by 4 (it can actually be any number between 2.7 and 6.3).
    - If you have the height and need a good width, just multiply the height by 4 (or anything between 2.7 and 6.3).
- Make sure anything important is located near the center of the image. This will ensure your header looks its best on mobile devices.
- Only use an original image created or captured by you or your team. 

## Making a quick header

If you don't want to make a custom image for your header, use a screenshot. A lot of screenshots turn out really nicely when blown up to header size.

If you have an image that is already 2000 pixels wide (or wider), it is ready to upload. If it is less than that, use some imaging software to scale it up to 2000 pixels wide. Don't resize it by percentage and make sure to preserve the aspect ratio. Don't resample the image and don't sharpen it.
