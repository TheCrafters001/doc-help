# Chat Guidelines

- Treat **everyone** with respect.
- Keep conversations confined to the appropriate chat rooms and forum threads.
- Do not post inappropriate links. Post nothing that might be considered NSFW (not safe for work).
- Cursing is frowned upon. You may be muted for repeated cursing or for particularly offensive words.
- No illegal, obscene, or overtly sexual language. Keep it family friendly.
- No racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, religious prejudice, nor any other kind of hate will be tolerated.
- Don't write in ALL CAPS (except for occasional emphasis).
- Don't send messages too quickly. Keep it at a human-readable pace.
- Don't use macros. Don't post ASCII art or extremely long messages that disrupt or obscure the flow of conversation.
- No advertising of any sort. You can post video links in the Let's Players chat room and links to your game in Developer Chat (but please don't just pop in and drop your link, and don't spam it).
- Please write in English only.
- If a moderator asks you to refrain from something that is not on this list, respect that modâ€™s wishes. They are there to keep things friendly and peaceful.
- If you are muted, you can plead your case in the General Forum's [Mute Appeal Thread](https://gamejolt.com/community/forums/topics/mute-appeal-thread/2185/).

If you have any questions or complaints, please email [contact@gamejolt.com](mailto:contact@gamejolt.com).
