# Adding video to my game page

The moving image is an incredibly effective medium. Humans just love it. So spruce up your game page with some videos! Adding a video is as simple as entering a link to it on Youtube or Vimeo and giving it a title (and, optionally, a description).

To add a video, go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/) and select your game from under "Your Games". You will be taken to the game's overview page. Visit the "Media" tab and start adding videos.

You can add videos that you created, but not videos that other people made about your game. Here are some ideas for what kinds of videos you can add:

- Game trailer
- Gameplay footage 
- Development timelapse 
- Developer Walkthrough 

Note that if your game is a work-in-progress and you haven't published a build, videos are probably the best way of showing off your development.
