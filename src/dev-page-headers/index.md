# Page Header Guide

Headers are the big, banner-like, rectangular images that adorn the tops of game pages. They are optional but highly, highly recommended. Headers make for a splendid looking page.

You might want to experiment with different images to see what looks good as a header. Screenshots often turn out well, but some of the nicest looking headers are created for the purpose.

## What are the header requirements and guidelines?

Here are the requirements and recommendations for header images:

- Use a rectangular image.
- The image format can be PNG, JPG, or GIF. PNGs will result in the highest quality.
- Your original image should be as large as possible.
- The minimum width is 900px. The maximum width is 5120px. - The minimum ratio (width รท height) is 2.7 and the maximum ratio is 6.3. The recommended ratio is 4. - We recommend making the height 25% of the width. - To find a good height, divide the width by 4 (it can actually be any number between 2.7 and 6.3). - If you have the height and need a good width, just multiply the height by 4 (or anything between 2.7 and 6.3).
- Make sure anything important is located near the center of the image. This will ensure your header looks its best on mobile devices.
- Only use an original image created or captured by you or your team.
