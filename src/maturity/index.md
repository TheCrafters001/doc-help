# What is a maturity rating?

Before you can unhide your game and show it to the world, you are required to give it a maturity rating. Maturity ratings are important because they allow people to make informed decisions about what they choose to play--or allow their children to play. We don't mind having games with mature content on the site as long as they are rated appropriately.

There are 3 possible maturity ratings:

- **All Ages** - Content is generally suitable for all ages, including young children. May contain minimal cartoon, fantasy or mild violence and/or infrequent use of mild language.
- **Teen** - May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood and/or infrequent use of strong language. Content is generally suitable for ages 14 and up.
- **Mature** - May include scenes of intense violence and/or graphic sexual content. Content suitable only for adults ages 18 and up.

Assign your game a rating, then go through the list and select any content tags that apply to your game.

Even if your game is a work-in-progress, it still needs a maturity rating to inform potential followers about the planned content. Give it a tentative rating and come back to make changes later.

We don't police maturity ratings, but if an inappropriate rating is reported to us, we will ask the developer to change it.
