# What is a maturity rating?

Before you unhide your game and show it to the world, you have to give it a maturity rating. Assign your game a rating, then go through the list and select any content tags that apply to your game.

We don't mind having games with mature content on the site as long as they are rated appropriately. In the system we currently use, OGRS (Open Game Rating System), there are 3 possible maturity ratings:

- All Ages 
- Teen
- Mature

Maturity ratings and content tags are important because they allow people to make informed decisions about what they choose to play--or allow their children to play. 

Even if your game is a work-in-progress, it still needs a maturity rating to inform potential followers about the planned content. Give it a tentative rating and come back to make changes later.

We don't police maturity ratings, but if an inappropriate rating is reported to us, we will ask the developer to change it.
