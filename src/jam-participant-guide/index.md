# How to Participate in a Game Jolt Jam

## Create a Developer Account

Already have one? Then skip to the next section. If not, read on.

- If you already have a gamer account: Sign in, then [go here](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/become-developer/) and click "Become a Developer". 
- If you don't have a Game Jolt account:[Sign up](http://gamejolt.com/auth/sign_up/) for one, and be sure to verify your email address. 

## Create a Game Page

Making a game page before your game is finished allows people to follow its development on the jam's activity feed (if the jam has one).

1. **Go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/),** where you can add and edit games. 
2. **Add your game.** Hit the big "Add a Game" button. Read and agree to the rules to continue. 
3. **Fill out the form** with information about your game. 

## Enter the Jam

To enter your game in the jam, **put the jam hashtag in the game's description**. You can edit the description from the game's management page on your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/). Make sure to add the hashtag after the jam begins.

## Unhide Your Game Page (optional but recommended)

- When you create a game page, it is hidden by default. Note that a game will be in the jam as long as the hashtag is in the description, even if the game page is hidden. 
- Before you can unhide your page, it needs two more things: a thumbnail and a maturity rating. You can add these from the game's management page on your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/). 
- When you're ready, click "Unhide your game." 

## Add Game Distributions

Before the jam's deadline, upload one or more game distributions (builds). Distributions, like game pages, are hidden by default, so be sure to unhide them.

## Don't Forget the Hashtag!

To enter your game in a jam, you must put the jam's hashtag somewhere in the game description. You should be able to find the jam's hashtag on the jam's homepage.
