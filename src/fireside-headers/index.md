# Fireside Header Images

They say a picture's worth 1,000 words... Our research shows it's really only about 500, but a header image is an integral addition to just about any post.

A header image looks fantastic on the page and attracts the attention of readers. Evidence suggests that posts with images are more frequently shared than those without, and images improve SEO (whatever that is). Furthermore, a header can capture eyes on the site's homepage, where it is used as your post's thumbnail image.

But perhaps more importantly, a strong header image introduces your article and sets the tone for your message. So choose wisely!

#### What Kind of Image Works Best?

Frankly, we're still figuring it out. One of the things we want to figure out during the beta period is what resolutions and aspect ratios work best, so play around and let us know.

In general, you probably want to choose a wide rectangular image that shows the most important content in the center. Basically, the image you upload will be centered horizontally and vertically, with the aspect ratio maintained. Additionally, your image will always be sized to fill the entire header area. Use the widest resolution possible to keep your header sharp, but try to keep the file size under 100KB.

Have fun! We're looking forward to your feedback.
