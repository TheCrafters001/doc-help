title: Why we need W9/W8 information
---

The IRS requires us to report US earnings and if you're not a US resident/citizen, we are required to collect a W8 form for proof of foreign residency/citizenship.

Although we collect this information from you, we do not store it on Game Jolt's servers. We work with Stripe to have them store and handle this information.

Our goal is for both of us to be compliant when selling games worldwide and avoid government fines and audits.

**For certain countries, Stripe may ask for additional supporting documents such as a scan of your ID, etc.**
