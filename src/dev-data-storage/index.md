# Data Storage Guide

Cloud data storage is a powerful feature of the Game API. You can use it for saving games or for hosting and sharing user-created content, like levels or maps. You can track player stats or allow asynchronous, turn-based online play. It can be used for an in-game messaging system or for instant replays. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination. We can't wait to see what you come up with!

You can store global data items and user data items. For the time being, only global data items can be viewed and managed from your dashboard.
