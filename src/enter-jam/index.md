# How to Enter a Game Jolt Jam

## Create a Developer Account

Already have one? Then skip to the next section. If not, read on.

- **If you already have a gamer account:** [Sign in](http://gamejolt.com/auth/login/), then [go here](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/become-developer/) and click "Become a Developer".
- **If you don't have a Game Jolt account:** [Sign up](http://gamejolt.com/auth/sign_up/) for one, and be sure to verify your email address.

## Create a Game Page

You can make a game page before your game is finished. This will allow people to follow your game's development on the jam's activity feed (if the jam has one).

1. **Go to your [developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/),** where you can add and edit games.
2. **Add your game.** Hit the big "Add a Game" button. Read and agree to the rules to continue.
3. **Fill out the form** with information about your game.

## Enter the Jam

To enter your game in the jam, **put the jam hashtag in the game's description**. You can edit the description from the game's management page on your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/). Make sure to add the hashtag after the jam begins, but before the jam ends.

Adding a jam hashtag creates an entry page on the jam site. The game's rank in the jam results will be calculated based on the ratings from the jam entry page, not the original game page.

## Add Game Distributions

Before the jam's deadline, upload one or more game distributions (builds). Distributions, like game pages, are hidden by default, so be sure to unhide them.

## Unhide Your Game Page

_Optional but recommended._

- When you create a game page, it is hidden by default. A game will show up in the jam as long as the hashtag is in its description, even if the game page is hidden; however, it won't show up in the regular Game Jolt game listings.
- Before you can unhide your page, it needs two more things: a thumbnail and a maturity rating. You can add these from the game's management page on your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard/).
- When you're ready, click "Unhide your game."

## Don't Forget the Hashtag!

To enter your game in a jam, you must put the jam's hashtag somewhere in the game description. You should be able to find the jam's hashtag on the jam's homepage.
