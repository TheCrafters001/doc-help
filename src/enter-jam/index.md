# How to enter a Game Jolt jam

## Create an account

Already have one? Then skip to the next section.

If you don't have a Game Jolt account, [create one](http://gamejolt.com/auth/sign_up/).

Be sure to verify your email address.

## Make a game page

You can create a game page before your game is finished. This will allow people to follow your development via the jam's activity feed (if the jam has one). Here's how:

1. Visit your **[developer dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard)**.
2. Hit the "Add Game" button on the left menu.
3. Read and agree to the rules to continue.
4. Fill out the form with information about your game.
5. Publish your game page (optional but recommended).

## Enter the jam

**Put the jam hashtag in the game description** to enter your game in the jam. You can edit the game description from the game's overview on your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard).

Adding a jam hashtag creates an entry page for the game on the jam site. Make sure to add the hashtag after the jam begins and before the jam ends.

## Add game files

Before the jam's deadline, upload your game's files. Go to your game overview and add a package, then add a release, and finally a build.

Learn about [packages, releases, and builds](https://help.gamejolt.com/dev-packages). 

Like game pages, releases are hidden by default, so be sure to unhide them.

## Publishing your game page

When you create a game page, it starts out hidden by default. You can enter a game in the jam even if its page remains unpublished.

As long as the jam hashtag is in the game description, the game will show up in the jam listing. However, that same game **will not** show up in the regular Game Jolt listings as long as it stays hidden.

Before you can publish your game page, you need to give your game a thumbnail and a maturity rating. You can add these from the game overview on your [dashboard](http://gamejolt.com/dashboard).

## Don't forget the hashtag!

To enter your game in a jam, you must put the jam's hashtag somewhere in the game description. You should be able to find the jam's hashtag on the jam's homepage.
