## How do EXP and levels work?

Certain things you do on the site will earn you EXP (experience points). Get enough EXP and you will level up!

An easy way to gain EXP is to rate and comment on the games you play. The most efficient way to level up quickly is to achieve in-game trophies and get on scoreboards.

Other than being a badge of honor (and an indicator of how much spare time you have), EXP is a mysterious commodity that has no practical use... yet.
